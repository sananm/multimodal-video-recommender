In "MicroLens-50k_pairs.tsv", each row corresponds to a user ID, and the subsequent columns represent the video IDs that
the user interacted with in chronological order. We use the "\t" delimiter to separate the user ID from the first video ID,
and a single space to separate different video IDs within the same row.

Additionally, we also provide the interaction file for MicroLens-100k (namely "MicroLens-50k_pairs.csv"), in which 
the three columns are "userID", "videoID" and "timestamp".
